@copilot here's what I'm seeing in anteew/comma-tools#78:

1. **Monitor docs over-promise.** README quick-start tells users to run `cts mon start` and MVP doc says the API matches the standalone CLIs, but the FastAPI app only mounts health, capabilities, runs, artifacts, and logs routers. There is no `/v1/monitors` route right now, so those instructions would 404. Please update the docs to match what actually ships (e.g., note monitor support is still in progress).
2. **Artifact endpoint mismatch.** `docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` lists a collection `GET /v1/artifacts`, yet the artifacts router only exposes `GET /runs/{run_id}/artifacts`, `GET /artifacts/{artifact_id}`, and `GET /artifacts/{artifact_id}/download`. The plan should call out the implemented routes instead of the nonexistent collection endpoint.

Let me know if you want me to sanity-check anything else!
