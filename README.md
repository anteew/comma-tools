## Code Formatting & Contribution Rules (Universal)

> **This section appears verbatim in all agent and contributor guidance files.  
> Read this in every README, AGENTS, CONTRIBUTING, and Copilot instruction file.  
> This policy is identical everywhereâ€”no file takes precedence.**

**All Python code in this repository must be formatted using [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) with a line length of 100.**  
This is enforced automatically by pre-commit hooks and CI.

- If your code is not formatted correctly, your commit will be rejected by pre-commit or CI checks.
- To check formatting locally:
  ```
  pre-commit run --all-files
  black --check src/ tests/
  ```
- To auto-format your code:
  ```
  black src/ tests/
  ```
- **For AI agents and all contributors:**  
  You must generate code that is already black-compatible (line length 100) or run "black" before committing code.  
  Code that does not pass `black --check` will not be accepted.

**Before contributing:**  
- Carefully read this section in all agent and contributor files (README, AGENTS.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, Copilot instructions, etc.).
- When in doubt, always refer to the README.md for the canonical version (which is identical to this).

For full details, see:
- [.pre-commit-config.yaml](.pre-commit-config.yaml)
- README.md
- .github/copilot-instructions.md
- docs/AGENTS.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
