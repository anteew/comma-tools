# CTS-Lite Service Architecture Implementation

> **⚠️ ARCHIVE NOTICE**: This document is now OBSOLETE and archived for historical reference.  
> **Current Status**: CTS-Lite is fully implemented and documented in the main README.md  
> **See**: [README.md](../README.md) for current CTS-Lite usage and documentation

This directory contains the architectural plans and implementation guides for the CTS-Lite HTTP API service.

## Documents

- **ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md**: Complete architectural specification and design
- **PHASE_1_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md**: Detailed implementation guide for Phase 1 (Service Foundation)
- **ARCHITECTURE_DIARY.md**: Ongoing architectural decisions and review log

└── PHASE_1_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md  # Phase 1 implementation guide
```

## Next Steps

1. **Merge this PR** to establish the architectural foundation
2. **Assign coding agent** to implement Phase 1 using the implementation guide  
3. **Architectural review** of the coding agent's implementation
4. **Continue with subsequent phases** as planned

## Implementation Phases

- **Phase 1** 🎯: Service Foundation (health, capabilities endpoints)
- **Phase 2**: Tool Registry and Execution  
- **Phase 3**: File Management
- **Phase 4**: Monitor Integration
- **Phase 5**: CLI Tool Deprecation
