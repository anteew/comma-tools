## Issues Identified & Resolutions

### ✅ **Issue 1: Inaccurate Test Count**

**Problem**: MVP definition states "11 comprehensive tests passing" but actual test suite is much larger.

**Reality Check**:
- **Total tests in repository**: ~263 tests
- **API tests specifically**: 61 tests (after Phase 2 implementation)  
- **Original Phase 1 API tests**: 11 tests

**Root Cause**: The "11 tests" was accurate for **Phase 1 only** but the MVP definition made it sound like the complete test suite.

**Resolution**: Update MVP definition to accurately reflect the comprehensive test coverage across all phases.

### ✅ **Issue 2: openpilot Dependency Not Documented**

**Problem**: Tests fail with FileNotFoundError on clean clone without `openpilot/` checkout.

**Reality Check**:
- Integration tests require `openpilot/` directory present
- `tests/conftest.py` uses `find_repo_root()` which expects `openpilot/` 
- This is a legitimate external dependency for integration testing

**Resolution**: Clearly document the `openpilot/` checkout requirement in MVP definition.

### ✅ **Issue 3: Overstated Implementation Status**

**Problem**: MVP definition describes `cts run --wait/--follow` as if implemented, but reviewer notes these depend on endpoints not yet available.

**Reality Check**:
- **Phase 2 IS complete**: `/v1/runs` endpoints are implemented (see `src/comma_tools/api/runs.py`)
- **Server IS wired**: `runs.router` is included in `server.py` (line 33)
- **Tests ARE passing**: 61 API tests including runs integration tests

**Resolution**: Verify current implementation status and update MVP accordingly.

## Architecture Assessment

Let me verify the actual implementation status before making corrections...

### **Phase 2 Implementation Verification**

✅ **Files Created**:
- `src/comma_tools/api/execution.py` (290 lines)
- `src/comma_tools/api/registry.py` (150 lines)  
- `src/comma_tools/api/runs.py` (156 lines)
- `tests/api/test_*.py` (4 new test files, 749 total lines)

✅ **Server Integration**:
- `runs.router` properly included in FastAPI app
- All Phase 2 endpoints should be available

✅ **Test Coverage**:
- 61 API tests total (substantial increase from 11)
- Integration tests with real analyzer execution

### **Recommended Corrections**

1. **Fix Test Count**: Update from "11 tests" to accurate current count
2. **Document Dependencies**: Add `openpilot/` checkout requirement  
3. **Verify Implementation**: Confirm Phase 2 functionality is actually working
4. **Update Status**: Adjust feature matrix to reflect true implementation state

## Action Plan

1. **Test the actual implementation** - verify `cts run` works end-to-end
2. **Update MVP definition** with accurate metrics and dependencies
3. **Add integration test documentation** for the `openpilot/` requirement
4. **Create corrected feature matrix** showing true completion status
