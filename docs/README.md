# Comma Tools Documentation

This directory contains the documentation source files for Comma Tools, which are written in reStructuredText (`.rst`) format and built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/).

## File Formats Explained

### Source Files (.rst)
The `.rst` files (like `index.rst`) are **source files** written in reStructuredText markup language. These are:
- **Human-readable** text files with simple formatting syntax
- **NOT the final product** - they need to be processed by Sphinx to generate the final documentation
- Similar to Markdown but with more advanced features for technical documentation

### Built HTML Files
The HTML files are the **final product** generated by Sphinx from the `.rst` source files. These are:
- **Generated automatically** by running the build process
- **What users see** when viewing the documentation in a web browser
- Located in the `_build/html/` directory (not committed to git)

## Building the Documentation

### Prerequisites
Install the documentation dependencies:
```bash
# From the repository root
pip install -e ".[docs]"
```

### Building HTML Documentation
You have several options to build the documentation:

#### Option 1: Using Make (Recommended)
```bash
cd docs/
make html
```

#### Option 2: Using Sphinx directly  
```bash
cd docs/
sphinx-build -b html . _build/html
```

#### Option 3: Using Python module
```bash
cd docs/
python -m sphinx -b html . _build/html
```

### Viewing the Documentation
After building, open `_build/html/index.html` in your web browser, or serve it locally:
```bash
cd docs/
make serve  # Serves at http://localhost:8000
```

### Development Workflow
For active development:
```bash
cd docs/
make watch  # Automatically rebuilds when files change (requires 'entr')
```

## Answer to Your Question

**Yes, `index.rst` needs to be processed to turn it into HTML.** 

- `index.rst` is the **source file** (not the final product)
- It contains reStructuredText markup that needs to be converted to HTML
- Run the build process (see above) to generate the final HTML documentation
- The generated `_build/html/index.html` is what users actually see

The documentation is already set up correctly - you just need to run the build process whenever you make changes to the `.rst` files.
