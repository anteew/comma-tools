# Architecture Diary

**Architect**: GitHub Copilot CLI  
**Project Manager**: Dan Mann  
**Project**: comma-tools CTS-Lite Service Architecture  

## Always Remember
- Keep plans small because it is much easier for a coding agent to do very focused work
- PRs are cheap, we can have hundreds or thousands of small PRs that are easier to reason about and easier to quality check
- Architecture review should happen before coding
- Core application logic must stay in service layer, never in frontends
- Single API surface for all tools - no duplicate entry points
- Every client (CLI, future web UI) should discover capabilities via API

## Timeline & Status

### 2024-12-19 - Initial Architecture Assessment ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Status**: Analysis completed, architectural foundation confirmed good

**What I Did**:
- Analyzed existing codebase architecture with Dan
- Confirmed current separation of concerns is correct:
  - ‚úÖ Core logic properly in service classes (analyzers/, monitors/, utils/)
  - ‚úÖ CLI tools are thin wrappers (good foundation)
  - ‚úÖ cts CLI client already designed for API service pattern
- Identified missing piece: CTS-Lite HTTP API service
- Confirmed Dan's vision: Single API surface with multiple client frontends

**Dan's Requirements Confirmed**:
- Eliminate standalone CLI tools (cruise-control-analyzer, rlog-to-csv, etc.)
- Single entry point: `cts` CLI client ‚Üí CTS-Lite API service
- Future-ready for web UI and other clients
- Self-discovering capabilities via API

### 2024-12-19 - CTS-Lite Service Architecture Plan ‚úÖ COMPLETED & MERGED
**Status**: Architectural plan successfully merged into main branch

**What I Did**:
- ‚úÖ Created feature branch: `feature/cts-lite-service-architecture`
- ‚úÖ Designed comprehensive CTS-Lite HTTP API service architecture
- ‚úÖ Created detailed 5-phase implementation plan
- ‚úÖ Defined API endpoints based on existing cts CLI expectations
- ‚úÖ Created skeleton directory structure (`src/comma_tools/api/`, `tests/api/`)
- ‚úÖ Wrote detailed Phase 1 implementation guide for coding agent
- ‚úÖ Established architectural compliance criteria
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive documentation structure
- ‚úÖ Created and merged PR #48

**Deliverables Merged**:
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` - Complete architectural specification
- `docs/PHASE_1_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Detailed Phase 1 coding instructions
- `docs/CTS_LITE_README.md` - Overview and next steps
- `src/comma_tools/api/` directory structure with package files
- `tests/api/` directory structure for API tests
- This diary for ongoing architectural tracking

**Pull Request**: #48 - MERGED ‚úÖ

### 2024-12-19 - Ready for Phase 1 Implementation üéØ NEXT
**Status**: Architecture approved, ready for coding agent assignment

**Expected Next Steps**:
1. ‚úÖ Dan merged architectural plan PR #48 
2. ‚úÖ Dan assigned coding agent to implement Phase 1 using PHASE_1_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md  
3. ‚úÖ Coding agent implemented Phase 1 in PR #49 (MERGED)
4. ‚úÖ I will review the coding agent's PR for architectural compliance
5. ‚è≥ Continue with subsequent phases

### 2024-12-19 - Phase 1 Implementation Review ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Status**: Phase 1 implementation reviewed and approved with minor gaps identified

**I looked at changes from PR #49 and they were MOSTLY compatible with what I need as the architect**

**What the Coding Agent Did Well** ‚úÖ:
- ‚úÖ **Service Foundation**: Proper FastAPI application with health and capabilities endpoints
- ‚úÖ **Configuration Management**: Environment variables and .env file support working correctly
- ‚úÖ **Tool Discovery**: Successfully exposes 3 analyzers with parameter schemas 
- ‚úÖ **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite including regression tests (11 tests passing)
- ‚úÖ **API Compliance**: Endpoints match cts CLI expectations perfectly
- ‚úÖ **Entry Point**: `cts-lite` command working correctly  
- ‚úÖ **Dependencies**: Proper pyproject.toml configuration with API extras
- ‚úÖ **Architecture Compliance**: No business logic in API layer - pure interface
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: Health endpoint < 100ms, capabilities < 500ms
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: OpenAPI docs available at /docs

**Service Verification** ‚úÖ:
- Health endpoint returns proper JSON: `{"status": "healthy", "version": "0.8.0", "uptime": "0d 0h 0m 2s"}`
- Capabilities endpoint lists 3 tools correctly
- All 11 tests pass consistently  
- `cts-lite` command starts service on port 8080
- Service responds within performance requirements

**Minor Gaps Identified for Phase 2** üîÑ:
1. **Missing Tool Execution**: No `/v1/runs` endpoint yet (expected for Phase 2)
2. **No cts CLI Integration**: `cts run` command not working yet (needs runs endpoint)
3. **Missing Background Tasks**: No async execution framework (needed for Phase 2)
4. **No File Management**: Upload/download not implemented (Phase 3 scope)

**Architecture Compliance** ‚úÖ:
- Core logic remains in analyzer classes - no duplication
- API layer is pure HTTP interface  
- Proper separation of concerns maintained
- Service-first architecture preserved

### 2024-12-19 - Phase 2 Planning ‚úÖ COMPLETED & FEEDBACK ADDRESSED
**Status**: Phase 2 planning completed and critical feedback integrated

**Next Tasks**:
1. ‚úÖ Create Phase 2 implementation guide for tool execution
2. ‚úÖ Plan tool registry system architecture  
3. ‚úÖ Design runs management endpoints
4. ‚úÖ Create PR #50 for Phase 2 planning
5. ‚úÖ Address critical GitHub feedback on threading and checkbox formatting
6. ‚è≥ Hand off to coding agent for implementation

**GitHub Feedback Addressed**:
- ‚úÖ **Copilot**: Fixed checkbox formatting - empty [ ] for Phase 2 requirements (not completed [x])
- ‚úÖ **chatgpt-codex-connector**: CRITICAL threading fix - replaced FastAPI BackgroundTasks with proper thread-based execution
- ‚úÖ **Dan**: Integrated all feedback changes into Phase 2 implementation guide

**Critical Architecture Fix**: 
- **Problem**: FastAPI BackgroundTasks run in same event loop and would block API during CPU-intensive analyzer work
- **Solution**: Use `asyncio.to_thread()` or `run_in_executor()` for proper thread isolation
- **Impact**: API remains responsive during tool execution, status endpoints work correctly

**Pull Request**: #50 - https://github.com/anteew/comma-tools/pull/50 (UPDATED with fixes)

## Architecture Decisions Log

### Decision 1: Service-First Architecture ‚úÖ
**Decision**: All application logic lives in service layer, clients are thin frontends
**Rationale**: Enables multiple client types (CLI, web UI, mobile) without code duplication
**Impact**: Clean separation of concerns, future-proof design

### Decision 2: Single API Surface ‚úÖ  
**Decision**: Eliminate standalone CLI tools, use only `cts` client ‚Üí CTS-Lite service
**Rationale**: Prevents user confusion, eliminates duplicate entry points
**Impact**: Consistent user experience across all client types

### Decision 3: Self-Discovering API ‚úÖ
**Decision**: API provides capabilities endpoint for tool/monitor discovery
**Rationale**: Clients can dynamically discover what's available
**Impact**: Future clients automatically inherit new tools without updates

### 2025-09-29 - API Version Checking System ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Status**: Version compatibility system implemented and merged

**What Was Done**:
- ‚úÖ Created `/v1/version` endpoint in CTS-Lite API (src/comma_tools/api/version.py)
- ‚úÖ Added client-side version checking on CLI startup (src/cts_cli/main.py)
- ‚úÖ Implemented semantic version comparison using `packaging` library
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive tests for version endpoint
- ‚úÖ Updated CLI version to match project version (0.8.0)
- ‚úÖ Documented system in README, AGENTS.md, and DEVELOPMENT.md

**Architecture Decision**: API/Client Version Compatibility System
- **Problem**: No mechanism to detect when API changes incompatibly with older clients
- **Solution**: Version endpoint with min_client_version enforcement
- **Benefits**:
  - Clear user feedback when upgrade needed
  - Foundation for future MCP server development
  - Prevents hard-to-debug compatibility issues
  - Graceful degradation with old servers

**Implementation Details**:
- API version: 0.1.0
- Min client version: 0.8.0
- Check happens transparently on every CLI invocation
- Fails fast with clear error message if incompatible
- Silently continues if endpoint doesn't exist (backward compatibility)

**Pull Request**: #111 - https://github.com/anteew/comma-tools/pull/111

## Architecture Decisions Log

### Decision 4: API Version Compatibility System ‚úÖ
**Decision**: Add `/v1/version` endpoint and automatic client version checking
**Rationale**: Prevent incompatible client/server combinations, enable safe API evolution
**Impact**:
- Clear user feedback when upgrades needed
- Foundation for MCP server support
- Safe API evolution without breaking existing clients
**Date**: 2025-09-29
