# Sample Report Directory

This directory contains example outputs that were historically generated by the deprecated cruise control analyzer tool. These files demonstrate the analysis output structure format and are preserved for reference purposes.

## Historical Files

### CSV Exports (with metadata headers)
- `counts_by_segment.csv` - CAN address activity by time segment
- `candidates.csv` - Bit-level analysis with scoring
- `edges.csv` - Bit transition events with timing
- `runs.csv` - Duration-based interval analysis
- `timeline.csv` - Chronological event timeline
- `engaged_intervals.csv` - Engaged state intervals

### JSON Exports (parallel data)
- `*.json` - JSON format of corresponding CSV data
- `*.analysis_meta.json` - Metadata sidecar files

### Reports
- `analysis_report.html` - Professional HTML analysis report
- `config_snapshot.json` - Complete analysis configuration

## Note on Tool Deprecation

The `cruise-control-analyzer` CLI tool has been deprecated and removed. For current analysis capabilities, please use the CTS-Lite API:

```bash
# Start the API server
cts-lite

# Use the unified CLI client
cts cap  # List available analyzers
cts run <analyzer-name> --path your-log.zst --wait
```

These sample files are preserved as examples of the analysis output format.
